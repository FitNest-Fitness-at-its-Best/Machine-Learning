# FitNest - Fitness At Its Best
Due to its drastic increase during the past decade, obesity is becoming an epidemic
phenomenon in most developed countries. 

In 2008, 1.5 billion adults were considered overweight (BMI≥ 25kg/m 2). Of these
over 200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese (BMI≥ 30kg/m 2).
Further, in 2010, around 43 million children under five were overweight and the
percentages are rising. In the past three decades, obesity rates for both adults and
children have increased significantly.

The fact that more than thirty-three percent of 
adults and sixteen percent of children are obese has proven to be one of the
biggest public health challenges to the general population and social welfare. Unfortunately,
obesity has still not been controlled effectively.

Also, due to COVID-19, people have been mostly eating at their homes only, leading
to the illusion that they’re eating healthy. The amount of preservatives they have
been intaking missing from fast food is immense. Mindless eating while working
from home can be a disaster to one's health.

This is why we propose a Food Detector - FitNest. Based on a photo taken by the user, the
app detects the food present and respectively finds nutritional information for the given
food. The user can then log this data into a virtual diary which would help keep
track of their calories consumed.

Business Model:
1. Swiggy Idea-Swiggy/Zomato could use this
2. Ads relating to various diet food items.
